# Integration-Project
To make this program work, make sure to download the 'resources' folder and have the folder be within the same directory as the main.py folder.

The program itself is a simple text adventure game that I made for my Introduction to Programming class. 
It is not very balanced due to some required components, and it is also not the best code in terms of readability or practicality, but I decided to leave the repository.
If someone wants to play it, they can. But I mostly kept it here as a reminder of how much I have grown as a programmer.
