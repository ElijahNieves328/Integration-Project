###############################INTRO#########################################
Hello and welcome to this thrilling text adventure.
You are a traveling knight who has come across a dark and ancient forest.
You have heard about the many dangers this forest holds, but you must keep moving forward, and the only way forward is through.
Besides, your steel is sturdy and your sword arm is strong. What could possibly happen that you could not handle?
##############################MECHANICS####################################
Lets take a look at the stats that will be relevant to you during this adventure.
HP:
As a sturdily built knight, you have {} Health Points.
Should this number ever reach 0, you will perish, forgotten to the forest forever.
MP:
While your primary means of combat is your steel, you are also capable of minor magic. You have {} total Magic Points.
You may use MP to cast minor spells, but the only one you know right now is Flame.
Flame does {} , but can also set things ablaze in the right circumstances.
If MP reaches 0, you can no longer cast spells until you regain MP. You regain full MP after each successful combat
Armor:
You have also been equipped by the kingdom's armory.
You wear full steel plate, which reduces incoming damage you will take by {}.
You also wield a devastating Greatsword, which does {} on hit.
##########################EVENT 1: SLIME#####################################
You have been traveling through the forest for some time now.
It's gnarled wood and sounds of creatures lurking in the dark are unsettling to say the least.
Hand gripping the hilt of your sword, you press onward, deeper into the forest, and deeper towards the sound of death.
Eventually, you come across a morbid scene.
You see a pile of gelatinous sludge, with a skeleton floating about inside. The armor the skeleton bears is one that matches your order.
The slime begins to lurch towards you!
You have successfully defeated the slime!
As its gelatinous form slowly begins to decompose, you notice a faint magic resonating from the skeleton it was eating.
The deceased knight's shield lays immaculate whereas the rest of the knight has been heavily decomposed.
The shield must have been enchanted with some form of protective magic.
You have obtained the Shield of Retribution. You may now choose to Block in combat.
If you do, rather than your Armor subtracting an amount of damage you are about to take, it will divide the damage by your Armor value.
It will also reflect an amount of damage equal to the remainder back at the enemy!
##############################EVENT 2: FOUNTAIN###############################
After fighting with the slime, you press onwards through the forest.
Eventually you come across a small bright outcropping, untouched by the dark and twisted nature of the forest.
Before you is a great fountain, with countless fairies flitting about around it.
From it, gushes forth a magical blue liquid. Being in its presence soothes your soul, despite your wounds.
What do you do?
"Drink" from the fountain  "Bathe" in the fountain   "Leave" the fountain alone
You cup your hands into the magical fountain's essence and drink.
Your body feels rejuvenated. You heal completely. Your HP is now {}.
The fairies are annoyed that you drank from their sacred fountain.
They decide to teach you a healing spell so that you may never come back to abuse their sacred waters.
You learn the Heal spell! When used, it will heal you for 10-12 HP for the cost 6 MP.
You clamber into the fountain with a large splash.
The fairies are furious with your disrespect and you feel pinches all over your body as they attack you.
Despite the fairy assault, you soak up the magical essence of the fountain.
Not only are you completely healed, but you also feel stronger than ever before. Your maximum HP has been tripled. Your HP is now {}.
The fairies thank you for respecting their holy fountain. They heal you and promise to give you aid when you need it most.
They also imbue you with their magic, giving you greater understanding of the arcane. Your maximum MP is now {}.
Your "Flame" has now become "Faerie Fire."
When used, not only will it do much more damage, but it will also set the target ablaze with an inextinguishable blue fire. This effect stacks.
###################################EVENT 3: ENT###############################
You push through the forest but cannot help but feel that the environment around you is changing.
As you walk through the gnarled underbrush, you could've sworn you saw something move out of the corner of your eye.
Right when you dismiss it as just a shadow, you step forward onto a tree root and the whole tree beneath begins to shift and bend.
You have encountered an Ent! It looks like it is about to attack.
The Ent cries out as it burns into cinders. The ashen roots and branches around you fall limp.
The Ent is consumed in blue flame. Once the pyre of blue light recedes, all that is left is a glowing ash.
The Ent struggles to move, but the majority of its wood has been chopped free of its body.
It twists, cracks, and then splinters into thousands of wood chips. The wood around you moves no more.
You have successfully defeated the Ent!
###########################EVENT 4: SWORD OR HELM###########################
As the wood of the forest recedes back into the shadows, you see a glimmer of light.
You see two objects made of magical metal, hidden beneath the underbrush.
Perhaps they were protecting this?
The first is a helm made of gold, with a large blue gem embedded into the forehead.
The second is a bright white sword, glowing with life energy. It is stuck within a large, rune-covered stone.
Which item do you want to take with you?
As you place the helm over your head, the blue gem begins to glow.
Your entire body is cloaked in a blue energy.
The energy begins to shape itself into an extra layer of translucent armor.
Your armor value has now increased to {}.
Additionally, if you block, all the energy focuses onto the shield.
Your shield now divides all damage by your armor value multiplied by itself.
As you approach the sword, you can feel the immense power it gives off.
With a quick look at it, and you can tell it would be no easy feat to pull this sword free.
You grab hold of the swords pommel and pull with all your might.
As you pull, you sense that this is not a test of physical strength, but a test of strength of the soul.
If you were to retrieve this sword, it would drain you of all your Magic.
Do you wish to continue?
You continue to pull, putting every ounce of energy and willpower you have into pulling it free, and eventually, the blade slides free of the stone.
It shines brilliantly in the moonlight, immaculate despite the unknown amount of years it has been kept here.
You now have the Sword of Exponential Power. The "Attack" action has become "Smite."
For any amount of damage you make with this sword, it will be multiplied by that same amount.
##########################EVENT 5: LICH#####################################
As you journey deeper through the forest, nearing the center, you begin to feel the most unsettling feeling you've felt in your entire lifetime.
A stench of death overcomes you and an arcane darkness fills the air. You feel as if this is the most incorrigible evil you have faced yet.
Surely, whatever is creating this aura of death must be the source of the forest's unforgiving nature.
You push further into the wood, steeling yourself against the vileness in the air, and then you see him.
A man, about 7 feet tall, with skin sloughing off of his body. His bone is exposed, but it appears to have merged with wood and fungus.
He turns to you, with hollowed eye sockets, and smiles the most abhorrent smile a creature could make.
"Ah... I see...," the Lich says. "It seems that another has wandered into my forest."
"Do not worry, brave knight. For I will accept you into my family as well..."
He then raises his arms and you see several bloated corpses of all kinds raise from the earth.
Knights, rogues, merchants, farmers... the Lich's evil seems to have touched all. You prepare for battle. The time for mercy has passed.
You finally manage to slice the Lich's head free from his body. As his head rolls across the dirt, all the bloated undead fall as well.
However, you can still hear a voice coming from the Lich's mouth
"Ah... what a powerful knight indeed... but not strong enough."
"You may think you have won over me, but none can truly defeat me! No matter how long it takes, I will always return!"
"You are strong, brave one... but I am beyond strength. I am The End. And I will come for you once I return..."
The flesh falls off the Lich's head and dissipates into shadow.
All around you, the forest begins to brighten and life begins to return to the noxious bogs.
You seem to have saved the forest from its accursed nature... or have you?
