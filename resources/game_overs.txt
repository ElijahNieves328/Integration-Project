#########################SLIME GAME OVER#############################
You have tried your hardest to repel the slime, but it does not yield.
Piece by piece, your armor corrodes. The acid begins to seep through and melt your flesh.
As you fall to one knee, the slime envelops towards you, absorbing you in its mass.
#########################ENT GAME OVER###############################
You try to cut down each branch that swings toward you, but more keep on coming.
Eventually, you are overcome, swatted down by the branches.
As you fall to the earth, roots sprout out around you, encasing you, and dragging you into the earth to become fertilizer for the trees.
#######################LICH GAME OVER###############################
You cut down undead after undead, but more keep on coming.
You cannot keep up, despite the powerful magical artifacts you hold.
As you try to fight back the horde, you feel a terrible magic grip hold of your body.
"Ah... how easily you are distracted... It appears this is the end, my brave knight."
"Your body can no longer keep up with my army. But fret not, for this outcome was predetermined."
"You were destined to serve me. I only thank you for working so hard to become such a powerful soldier of my army"
You feel your flesh begin to rot. You try to scream, but your vocal cords are completely decomposed.
As your flesh sloughs off, you begin to lose what little is left of your mind.
